# QUINIELAS (1X2)

1X2 is a small Data Science project with the goal to help on making spanish quinielas. More important than making good predictions on future football games, is to create a full data science project from scratch and practise the Python language.

- Get data from API source
- Automatically and periodically update databases with API information
- Clean the data
- Use AWS to store and exploit databases
- Make predictions with machine learning 
- Use Plotly Dash or Shiny (Â¿?) to create a functional dashboard to configure and visualize games and probabilities for each future game

Tools and technologies used: 
- Python (pandas, numpy, json)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, GBM, SVM, KNN...)
- APIs
- AWS
- Databases
- Matplotlib for small visualizations

Work in progress...
